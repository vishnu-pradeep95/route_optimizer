## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 5-01: Dropped MAC from fingerprint (WSL2 generates random MAC on reboot, microsoft/WSL#5352)
- Phase 5-01: Used exact match (not similarity scoring) for fingerprint validation
- Phase 5-02: Read-only bind mount (:ro) for /etc/machine-id to prevent container writes to host identity

See also: PROJECT.md Key Decisions table, `.planning/milestones/` for full phase details per milestone.

### Pending Todos

2 pending -- see `.planning/todos/pending/`

### Blockers/Concerns

- Google Maps API key is currently invalid (REQUEST_DENIED) -- E2E tests must use pre-geocoded seed data.
- Physical Android device testing required for outdoor contrast validation.
